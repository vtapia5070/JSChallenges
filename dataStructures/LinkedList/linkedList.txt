Definiton:
  Linked Lists are a collection of objects, or nodes, in which each node can form a link, or a reference, to another node.
  They are references by their relationship with each individal node before or after them.

  The Linkedist usually has a Node constructor function that creates each node, with a value property and next property that will reference another node, or null if it doesn't reference a node yet.

  It also has a class that holds all of the methods that can add and remove nodes, maintaing the head and tail nodes, and other house keeping funtions/information.

Advantages:
  Linked Lists are a great alternative to using arrays since arrays have a fixed length, and are less efficent when adding or deleting an element.

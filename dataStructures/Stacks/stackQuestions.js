/*
How would you use a single array to implement three stacks?
*/

/*
How would you implement a stck that also has a min method that returns the minimum element?
Push, pop, and min should all operate in O(1) time.
*/

/*
Implement a datastructure SetOfStacks that mimics a stack that creates a new stack when it's previous stack exceeds some threshold or capacity.
This SetOfStacks should have a SetOfStacks.push(), SetOfStacks.pop(), and should act identically to a single stack.

** Implement a popAt(index) which performs a pop operation on a set of sub-stacks.

Definition:
  Stacks are list-like data structure that allow data to be added and removed from the end of the list.

  A realistic example of this data structure is a stack of papers.

  As you add a paper to the top of the stack, the order in which you remove a paper is off of the top of the stack.
  This pattern is usually refered to as LIFO ("Last in, first out").

  This data structure usually has a class that contains a storage of all of the data and methods:
  push (add to stack), pop (remove from stack), length (Size of stack), and peek (view data on the top of stack).

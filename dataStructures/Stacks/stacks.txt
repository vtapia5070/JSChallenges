Definition:
  Stacks are list-like data structure that allow data to be added and removed from the end of the list.

  A realistic example of this data structure is a stack of papers.

  As you add a paper to the top of the stack, the order in which you remove a paper is off of the top of the stack.
  This pattern is usually refered to as LIFO ("Last in, first out").

  Another realist example is the Javascript event loops call stack. As JS functions are invoked, they are added to the call stack.
  In the instancce where one function calls another function, the second function is added on top of the call stack.
  Inorder for the first function to be removed from the call stack, each function (starting at the top of the call stack) has to be returned or
  exited.

  This data structure usually has a class that contains a storage of all of the data and methods:
  push (add to stack), pop (remove from stack), Size (length of stack), and peek (view data on the top of stack).

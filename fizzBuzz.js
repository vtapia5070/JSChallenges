/*
* Players generally sit in a circle. The first player says the number “1”,
* and each player says next number in turn. However, any number divisible by X 
* (for example, three) is replaced by the word fizz, and any divisible by Y (for 
* example, five) by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A 
* player who hesitates, or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

* Write a program that prints out the final series of numbers where those divisible
* by X, Y and both are replaced by “F” for fizz, “B” for buzz and “FB” for fizz buzz.

* CONSTRAINTS:

* The number of test cases ≤ 20
* "X" is in range [1, 20]
* "Y" is in range [1, 20]
* "N" is in range [21, 100]
